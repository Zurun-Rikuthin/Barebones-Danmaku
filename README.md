This game was created for the "[Bare-bones Game Jam #1](<https://itch.io/jam/the-bare-bones-game-jam>)" hosted by @"[gameboymarcus](https://gameboymarcus.itch.io/)" on October 10th, 2025.

This version of the scrolling background keeps the player
centered on the GamePanel and the image scrolls in the
left, right, up, and down directions. If an edge of the image
is reached (from any direction), scrolling stops in that
direction.

The player is therefore able to move around arbitrarily 
large images. Only one background is used so "infinite"
movement along any direction is not possible.
